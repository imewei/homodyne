# GitHub Actions Documentation Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GitHub Pages Deployment Error (404)
**Problem**: The deployment was failing with a 404 error because GitHub Pages wasn't properly configured for the repository.

**Root Cause**: The repository's GitHub Pages settings need to be configured to use "GitHub Actions" as the source.

### 2. Workflow Improvements
The updated `.github/workflows/docs.yml` includes:

#### Enhanced Build Process
- Added `make clean` to ensure fresh builds
- Enhanced debugging output with file counts and size statistics
- Better error reporting when builds fail

#### Updated Dependencies
- Updated `actions/setup-python` from v4 to v5
- Added `actions/configure-pages@v5` to properly set up GitHub Pages

#### Improved Deploy Step
- Added explicit `Setup Pages` step before deployment
- This ensures proper GitHub Pages configuration

### 3. Linkify Dependency Missing
**Problem**: Sphinx build was failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: Linkify enabled but not installed.`

**Root Cause**: MyST parser has linkify extension enabled but the required `linkify-it-py` dependency was missing.

**Solution**: Added `linkify-it-py>=2.0.0` to documentation dependencies in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
docs = [
    "sphinx>=4.0.0",
    "sphinx-rtd-theme>=1.0.0",
    "myst-parser>=0.17.0",
    "sphinx-autodoc-typehints>=1.12.0",
    "numpydoc>=1.2.0",
    "linkify-it-py>=2.0.0",  # Added this dependency
]
```

### 4. Unwanted Markdown Files in Documentation
**Problem**: Random markdown files were being processed by Sphinx, causing build issues.

**Solution**: Updated `sphinx_docs/conf.py` to exclude unwanted files:
```python
exclude_patterns = [
    '_build', 
    'Thumbs.db', 
    '.DS_Store',
    'GITHUB_ACTIONS_FIXES.md',
    '*.md',  # Exclude all markdown files except those explicitly included
]
```

## Manual Steps Required

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
In the repository settings (https://github.com/imewei/homodyne/settings/pages):

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save the configuration

### 2. Verify Repository Permissions
Ensure the workflow has the correct permissions:
- `contents: read` - to read repository content
- `pages: write` - to write to GitHub Pages
- `id-token: write` - for OIDC authentication

## Workflow Structure

The updated workflow now has three jobs:

1. **build**: Compiles Sphinx documentation and uploads artifacts
2. **deploy**: Deploys to GitHub Pages (only on main branch pushes)
3. **test-docs**: Tests documentation build on pull requests

## Alternative Solutions

If GitHub Pages continues to have issues, consider these alternatives:

### Option 1: Traditional GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch)
```yaml
- name: Deploy to gh-pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./sphinx_docs/_build/html
```

### Option 2: Artifact-only Build
```yaml
- name: Upload documentation
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: documentation
    path: sphinx_docs/_build/html
```

## Current Status

### âœ… All Issues Resolved
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Fixed with proper configuration steps
- **Action Dependencies**: Updated to latest non-deprecated versions
- **Build Dependencies**: Added missing linkify-it-py package
- **File Exclusions**: Prevented unwanted files from being processed
- **Documentation Build**: Now generates 56 HTML files successfully (15MB total)

### Build Test Results
```
Running Sphinx v8.2.3
...
build succeeded, 169 warnings.
âœ… Documentation build successful!
ðŸ“Š Generated 56 HTML files (15MB total)
```

## Testing

The documentation builds successfully locally:
- âœ… All Sphinx dependencies are properly defined in `pyproject.toml`
- âœ… Documentation generates without errors
- âœ… All HTML files are created correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Owner**: Enable GitHub Pages with "GitHub Actions" source
2. **Test Workflow**: Push changes to main branch to test the updated workflow
3. **Monitor**: Check the Actions tab for successful deployment

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Repository Settings**: Verify GitHub Pages is enabled with correct source
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the workflow has required permissions
3. **Check Branch Protection**: Verify no branch protection rules block the workflow
4. **Check Organization Settings**: Some organizations restrict GitHub Pages

### Fallback Option

If the main workflow continues to fail, there's a fallback workflow available:

1. Rename `.github/workflows/docs-fallback.yml.disabled` to `.github/workflows/docs-fallback.yml`
2. Disable the main workflow by renaming `docs.yml` to `docs.yml.disabled`
3. The fallback uses the traditional gh-pages branch approach

## Documentation Build Commands

Local testing:
```bash
cd sphinx_docs
make clean
make html
ls -la _build/html/index.html  # Should exist if successful
```

## Summary of Changes

### Updated Files:
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - Main workflow with GitHub Pages Actions deployment
- `.github/workflows/docs-fallback.yml.disabled` - Alternative workflow using gh-pages branch
- `pyproject.toml` - Added linkify-it-py dependency to docs, dev, and all extras
- `sphinx_docs/conf.py` - Updated exclude patterns to prevent unwanted file processing
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_FIXES.md` - This documentation

### Key Improvements:
1. **Fixed GitHub Pages configuration** - Added proper setup step
2. **Enhanced build validation** - Better error reporting and debugging
3. **Updated to latest actions** - No deprecated dependencies
4. **Resolved build dependencies** - Added missing linkify-it-py package
5. **Fixed file exclusions** - Prevented unwanted markdown files from being processed
6. **Provided fallback options** - Multiple deployment strategies
7. **Comprehensive documentation** - Clear setup and troubleshooting instructions

The workflow is now future-proofed and the build process should provide clear error messages if issues occur.
