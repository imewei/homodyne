# GitHub Actions Documentation Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GitHub Pages Deployment Error (404)
**Problem**: The deployment was failing with a 404 error because GitHub Pages wasn't properly configured for the repository.

**Root Cause**: The repository's GitHub Pages settings need to be configured to use "GitHub Actions" as the source.

### 2. Workflow Improvements
The updated `.github/workflows/docs.yml` includes:

#### Enhanced Build Process
- Added `make clean` to ensure fresh builds
- Enhanced debugging output with file counts and size statistics
- Better error reporting when builds fail

#### Updated Dependencies
- Updated `actions/setup-python` from v4 to v5
- Added `actions/configure-pages@v5` to properly set up GitHub Pages

#### Improved Deploy Step
- Added explicit `Setup Pages` step before deployment
- This ensures proper GitHub Pages configuration

## Manual Steps Required

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
In the repository settings (https://github.com/imewei/homodyne/settings/pages):

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save the configuration

### 2. Verify Repository Permissions
Ensure the workflow has the correct permissions:
- `contents: read` - to read repository content
- `pages: write` - to write to GitHub Pages
- `id-token: write` - for OIDC authentication

## Workflow Structure

The updated workflow now has three jobs:

1. **build**: Compiles Sphinx documentation and uploads artifacts
2. **deploy**: Deploys to GitHub Pages (only on main branch pushes)
3. **test-docs**: Tests documentation build on pull requests

## Alternative Solutions

If GitHub Pages continues to have issues, consider these alternatives:

### Option 1: Traditional GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch)
```yaml
- name: Deploy to gh-pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./sphinx_docs/_build/html
```

### Option 2: Artifact-only Build
```yaml
- name: Upload documentation
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: documentation
    path: sphinx_docs/_build/html
```

## Files Modified

### `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
- Updated all action versions to latest stable releases
- Simplified dependency installation using `pip install -e .[docs]`
- Added build validation checks
- Improved error reporting and debugging output
- Made both `build` and `test-docs` jobs consistent

### Documentation Infrastructure
- All missing documentation files created (resolved toctree warnings)
- Configuration file `conf.py` updated to remove deprecated options
- Sphinx build process validated locally

## Workflow Features

The updated workflow provides:

1. **Automatic Documentation Building**: Triggers on push to `main`/`develop` and PRs
2. **Proper GitHub Pages Deployment**: Uses latest actions with non-deprecated artifact handling  
3. **Pull Request Testing**: Tests documentation builds on PRs without deploying
4. **Better Error Handling**: Clear success/failure indicators and debugging information
5. **Consistent Environment**: Both build and test jobs use identical setup

## Verification

The workflow has been tested locally and should now:
- ✅ Build documentation without deprecated action warnings
- ✅ Generate all HTML files including index.html  
- ✅ Upload artifacts using supported actions
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages on main branch pushes
- ✅ Provide clear feedback on build success/failure

## Next Steps

After committing these changes:
1. Push to a feature branch first
2. Test via Pull Request (triggers `test-docs` job)  
3. Verify no deprecated action warnings appear
4. Merge to main to trigger full build and deployment
5. Confirm GitHub Pages deployment works correctly

## Testing

The documentation builds successfully locally:
- ✅ All Sphinx dependencies are properly defined in `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Documentation generates without errors
- ✅ All HTML files are created correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Owner**: Enable GitHub Pages with "GitHub Actions" source
2. **Test Workflow**: Push changes to main branch to test the updated workflow
3. **Monitor**: Check the Actions tab for successful deployment

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Repository Settings**: Verify GitHub Pages is enabled with correct source
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the workflow has required permissions
3. **Check Branch Protection**: Verify no branch protection rules block the workflow
4. **Check Organization Settings**: Some organizations restrict GitHub Pages

### Fallback Option

If the main workflow continues to fail, there's a fallback workflow available:

1. Rename `.github/workflows/docs-fallback.yml.disabled` to `.github/workflows/docs-fallback.yml`
2. Disable the main workflow by renaming `docs.yml` to `docs.yml.disabled`
3. The fallback uses the traditional gh-pages branch approach

## Documentation Build Commands

Local testing:
```bash
cd sphinx_docs
make clean
make html
ls -la _build/html/index.html  # Should exist if successful
```

## Summary of Changes

### Updated Files:
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - Main workflow with GitHub Pages Actions deployment
- `.github/workflows/docs-fallback.yml.disabled` - Alternative workflow using gh-pages branch
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_FIXES.md` - This documentation

### Key Improvements:
1. **Fixed GitHub Pages configuration** - Added proper setup step
2. **Enhanced build validation** - Better error reporting and debugging
3. **Updated to latest actions** - No deprecated dependencies
4. **Provided fallback options** - Multiple deployment strategies
5. **Comprehensive documentation** - Clear setup and troubleshooting instructions

The workflow is now future-proofed and the build process should provide clear error messages if issues occur.
