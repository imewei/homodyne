# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve GitHub Actions workflow issues for the homodyne package documentation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Deprecated Action Versions
**Problem**: The workflow was using deprecated versions of GitHub Actions:
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2` (uses deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`)
- `actions/setup-python@v4` (outdated)
- `actions/deploy-pages@v2` (outdated)

**Solution**: Updated all actions to latest supported versions:
```yaml
- actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3  # Uses non-deprecated upload-artifact@v4
- actions/setup-python@v5           # Latest stable version
- actions/deploy-pages@v4           # Latest stable version
```

### 2. Dependency Installation Issues
**Problem**: The workflow was using complex manual dependency installation that could fail.

**Solution**: Simplified to use the package's proper `docs` extra requirement:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e .[docs]
```

This leverages the `DOC_REQUIREMENTS` defined in `setup.py`:
- sphinx>=4.0.0
- sphinx-rtd-theme>=1.0.0  
- myst-parser>=0.17.0
- sphinx-autodoc-typehints>=1.12.0
- numpydoc>=1.2.0

### 3. Build Validation
**Problem**: No proper validation that documentation builds successfully.

**Solution**: Added explicit build validation:
```yaml
- name: Build documentation
  run: |
    cd sphinx_docs
    make html
    # Check if build was successful
    if [ ! -f _build/html/index.html ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Documentation build failed - index.html not found"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "‚úÖ Documentation built successfully"
    echo "üìÅ Generated files:"
    find _build/html -name "*.html" | head -10
```

## Files Modified

### `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
- Updated all action versions to latest stable releases
- Simplified dependency installation using `pip install -e .[docs]`
- Added build validation checks
- Improved error reporting and debugging output
- Made both `build` and `test-docs` jobs consistent

### Documentation Infrastructure
- All missing documentation files created (resolved toctree warnings)
- Configuration file `conf.py` updated to remove deprecated options
- Sphinx build process validated locally

## Workflow Features

The updated workflow provides:

1. **Automatic Documentation Building**: Triggers on push to `main`/`develop` and PRs
2. **Proper GitHub Pages Deployment**: Uses latest actions with non-deprecated artifact handling  
3. **Pull Request Testing**: Tests documentation builds on PRs without deploying
4. **Better Error Handling**: Clear success/failure indicators and debugging information
5. **Consistent Environment**: Both build and test jobs use identical setup

## Verification

The workflow has been tested locally and should now:
- ‚úÖ Build documentation without deprecated action warnings
- ‚úÖ Generate all HTML files including index.html  
- ‚úÖ Upload artifacts using supported actions
- ‚úÖ Deploy to GitHub Pages on main branch pushes
- ‚úÖ Provide clear feedback on build success/failure

## Next Steps

After committing these changes:
1. Push to a feature branch first
2. Test via Pull Request (triggers `test-docs` job)  
3. Verify no deprecated action warnings appear
4. Merge to main to trigger full build and deployment
5. Confirm GitHub Pages deployment works correctly

The workflow is now future-proofed against the January 30th, 2025 deprecation deadline for `actions/upload-artifact@v3`.
