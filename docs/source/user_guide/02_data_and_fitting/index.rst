**What you will learn:**

- How to prepare and load HDF5 two-time correlation data.
- How to run NLSQ fitting for static and laminar flow modes.
- How to select between static and laminar flow analysis modes.
- How to interpret optimization results, chi-squared, and uncertainties.

**Prerequisites:** :doc:`../01_fundamentals/index` and a working Homodyne
installation (:doc:`/installation`).
