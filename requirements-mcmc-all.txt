# MCMC All Backends Dependencies (Isolated Architecture)
# Includes both CPU and GPU backends for complete MCMC functionality
# Isolated backend architecture prevents PyTensor/JAX conflicts

# Include core dependencies
-r requirements.txt

# CPU Backend (Pure PyMC - isolated from JAX)
-r requirements-mcmc-cpu.txt

# GPU Backend (Pure NumPyro/JAX - isolated from PyMC)  
-r requirements-mcmc-gpu.txt

# Usage:
# pip install -r requirements-mcmc-all.txt
# homodyne --method mcmc      # Pure PyMC CPU backend
# homodyne-gpu --method mcmc  # Pure NumPyro/JAX GPU backend with CPU fallback

# Alternative installation:
# pip install homodyne-analysis[mcmc-all]

# Architecture Benefits:
# - Complete backend isolation prevents conflicts
# - CPU backend: Pure PyMC, no JAX contamination
# - GPU backend: Pure NumPyro/JAX, no PyMC contamination
# - Cross-platform compatibility
# - Automatic environment configuration per backend
