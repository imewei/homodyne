# MCMC CPU Backend Dependencies (Isolated)
# Pure PyMC implementation - completely isolated from JAX/NumPyro
# For CPU-only Bayesian MCMC sampling with PyMC

# Include core dependencies
-r requirements.txt

# PyMC CPU Backend (isolated from JAX)
pymc>=5.0.0
arviz>=0.12.0
pytensor>=2.8.0
corner>=2.2.0

# Usage:
# pip install -r requirements-mcmc-cpu.txt
# homodyne --method mcmc  # Uses pure PyMC CPU backend

# Architecture Notes:
# - This backend is completely isolated from JAX/NumPyro
# - PyTensor is configured for CPU-only operation
# - No JAX imports to avoid namespace conflicts
# - Suitable for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
