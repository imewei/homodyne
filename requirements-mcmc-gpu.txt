# MCMC GPU Backend Dependencies (Isolated)
# Pure NumPyro/JAX implementation - completely isolated from PyMC
# For GPU-accelerated Bayesian MCMC sampling with NumPyro

# Include core dependencies
-r requirements.txt

# JAX backend for GPU/CPU operations
jax[cuda12-local]>=0.7.0 ; sys_platform == 'linux'
jax>=0.7.0 ; sys_platform != 'linux'
jaxlib>=0.4.35

# NumPyro GPU Backend (isolated from PyMC)
numpyro>=0.13.0

# Usage:
# pip install -r requirements-mcmc-gpu.txt
# homodyne-gpu --method mcmc  # Uses pure NumPyro/JAX backend with GPU/CPU fallback

# Architecture Notes:
# - This backend is completely isolated from PyMC/PyTensor
# - JAX handles both GPU and CPU operations with automatic fallback
# - No PyMC imports to avoid namespace conflicts
# - Linux: Full GPU acceleration with CUDA 12.6+
# - macOS/Windows: Automatic CPU fallback within JAX ecosystem
